<div id='content'>

<p>The <a target="_blank" href='gen.html'>Epic Tome Sealed Deck Generator</a> is a tool
for practicing for Sealed Pack tournaments. Here's how to use it:
</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the kind of pool you'd like to build using the "Core Set
Packs" and "Time Wars Packs" drop-downs.</li>
<li>Click "Generate." Your pool will be populated from cards from
randomly-generated boosters of the given sets. The Sealed Deck Generator uses
print runs, described in
<a href='http://www.epictcg.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1428'>
this forum thread</a></li>
<li>Build your deck by figuring out which 30 cards you want to play. Cards
in your pool are draggable with the mouse and can be sorted by selecting an
option in the "Sort by" drop-down, or by clicking the "Sort" button.</li>
<li>
Move the cards you want for your sideboard to the column marked "SIDEBOARD."
Move the cards you don't want to play at all to the Trash. Double-clicking a
card in your pool will move it to the sideboard, if it isn't already full, or
the trash, if it is.
</li>
<li>When your pool has exactly 30 cards remaining, click the "Save" button
to download a .mwDeck file containing a listing of the pool that you've built.
Now you can goldfish it or play it against your friends!</li>
<li>Finally, be sure to look for new developments in the
